    From 2018–⁠2019 I was leading the design and development of the Commons marketplace, a Web3 data marketplace to explore, download, and publish open data sets registered in the [Ocean Protocol](/oceanprotocol) network.

    As the main frontfacing UI of Ocean Protocol, it serves as a product and showcase bringing together the complete Ocean Protocol stack in a simple interface. Additionally, the project was created with developers in mind, making Commons the most complete boilerplate for creating dApps on top of Ocean Protocol.

#     Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

#     Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services. All design & development is embedded in continuous deployment processes via GitHub, Travis, Kubernetes, and Now.

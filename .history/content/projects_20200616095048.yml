    From 2018–⁠2019 I was leading the design and development of the Commons marketplace, a Web3 data marketplace to explore, download, and publish open data sets registered in the [Ocean Protocol](/oceanprotocol) network.

    As the main frontfacing UI of Ocean Protocol, it serves as a product and showcase bringing together the complete Ocean Protocol stack in a simple interface. Additionally, the project was created with developers in mind, making Commons the most complete boilerplate for creating dApps on top of Ocean Protocol.

    Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services. All design & development is embedded in continuous deployment processes via GitHub, Travis, Kubernetes, and Now.

    From 2015–2017 I was co-designing and leading the UI design & development of various ChartMogul web properties. This included the creation of a components-based UI design system and implementing it across all web touch points.

    The main website with its landing pages is a static site built with Jekyll and a custom Gulp-based build pipeline in front of it, while the blog is running on WordPress with its own custom theme. All embedded in an automated development & deployment workflow via GitHub and Travis.

    Besides designing and implementing new features, I maintained the front-end of the ChartMogul application and implemented the UI design system by refactoring most of its front-end codebase.

    All branding, design & key visuals directed by Michelle Myung.

    From 2012–2015 I worked at ezeep, where I helped creating an unprecedented, market-leading & award-winning user experience based on the principles of emotional design way ahead of all competitors. This included conceptualizing executing, and iterating on the creative & visual direction of the ezeep brand.

    I was leading the UI design & development of all ezeep touch points and - as a product designer - defined the ezeep product based on user and market research in an iterative process. On top of that, I designed and helped building all app experiences of ezeep on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

    ezeep was acquired by [Cortado AG](https://www.cortado.com) in 2015 and became part of their [ThinPrint Cloud Services](https://www.thinprintcloud.com) suite of products.
